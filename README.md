# FortifyFi

A tower defense game where your real spending habits determine how hard the enemy waves hit. Save more, defend better.

**Live app:** https://forti-fy.vercel.app

## How it works

1. **Upload your statement** — upload a bank statement PDF or TXT, or use the built-in demo samples
2. **AI analysis** — Claude parses transactions, categorizes spending, and calculates a weekly financial score (0–100)
3. **Goal Agent** — identifies your riskiest spending category and sets a targeted reduction goal
4. **Play the game** — your score sets the enemy wave difficulty. Good spending = easy wave. Overspending = relentless horde
5. **NPC advisors** — 5 AI advisors debrief you with personalized feedback based on your spending history
